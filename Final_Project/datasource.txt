Our data was sourced from Kaggle and includes data pertaining to songs on Spotify and YouTube. From the original dataset, we removed 
fields we felt were unnecessary, such as the YouTube video description variable, and cleaned up accents and symbols that did not 
translate well. We then split the data into smaller entities that we felt best represented different aspects of each song (ex. having 
separate entities for the album info and the artist info).
We capped the dataset at 1507 data points/rows. For SQL purposes, we split the main dataset into smaller csv files to represent each 
entity. ID columns that did not already exist were created.

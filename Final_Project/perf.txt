-- Lists the statements used to create indexes (queries that were affected by the indexes and time consumption before and after adding the index)
To enhance the performance of the database, an ID column was added to each entity table in order to serve as the primary key. For instance, the "Musicality" table now
includes a "Musicality_ID" column with an INT data type and PRIMARY KEY constraint. Similar modifications were made to the "Energy", "Human_Connection", "Spoken_Volume", "Spotify_YouTube", "YouTube_Video", and "Performance" tables. The auto-incrementing ID column ensures a unique identifier for each record. The database schema and 
structure were adjusted seamlessly to accommodate the new column, contributing to improved data management without affecting the performance of pre-existing queries.
